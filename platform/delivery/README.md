# Build and Deploy

It automatically builds and deploy the latest commit.

Trigger the CircleCI build in the latest commit of the target branch.
After CircleCI completes, it will create a branch in the platform-deployment repository
and commit to it with the following commit message: "[input.command]{input.apps} Created by Github Actions from ${{ github.event.repository.name }}"
The commit will use the latest short-commit in the chartVersion.
