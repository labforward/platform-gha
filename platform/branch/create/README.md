# Create Branch in platform-deployment Repository

Creates a new branch named gha-{current-branch}. 
Then, creates a new commit replacing the chartVersion with the latest commit hash.
If the branch already exists, then it will create only the new commit.

# Inputs and Outputs

Check the inputs and outputs in the [action file](action.yml).

# Usage Example
The example is creating a new branch in the platform-deployment repository via a manual trigger in the Actions tab.
Also, it updates the *chartVersion* in the *chart-name* manifest file with the short-commit hash of the latest commit of the target branch.
